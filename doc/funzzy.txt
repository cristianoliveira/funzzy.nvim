EXAMPLES                                                  *funzzy-examples*

 *Arbitrary_Commands* - Opens the directory/file you want work and execute the
 command below, this will spin a funzzy process which will watch the directory
 where the file is and will execute the command you passed as argument

 `:FunzzyCmd echo "this file changed {{filepath}}"`

 *Configured_Tasks* - First configure the task file with `:FunzzyInit` once that
 is done execute `:Funzzy` which will spin the watcher and watch based on the
 configured tasks in `.watch.yaml`

 *Target_Tasks* - Assuming that you have the `.watch.yaml` below if you run
 the command `:Funzzy quick` it will only load the rules that contains `quick`
 in the name
 ```
  - name: run test (quick)
    run: "echo 'foo bar baz' | sed 's/foo/FIRST/g'"
    change: "libs/**"

  - name: run fmt (quick)
    run: "ls | sed 's/Cargo/Foo/g'"
    change: "src/**"

  - name: run e2e (slow)
    run: "webdriver"
    change: "e2e/**"
  ```
